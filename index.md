This series of posts describe how to install Linux to a USB flash-drive, compatible with UEFI, and enable dual-boot with current Operating System on the host device.


Prerequisites are:


- Install [Virtual Box][link__virtual_box]

- Obtain a USB drive to install Linux to, so far I've had good experiences with [Sandisk Low-Profile USB3][link__amazon__usb_drive] drives

- Download a Linux ISO, this guide will be using [Mint 19.2][link__mint_19_2]


After satisfying the above requirements start with the [Install Linux to USB via VirtualBox][collection__virtual_box] collection of pages, and after completing steps there following the [USB Linux First Boot][collection__first_boot] instructions is a very good idea.


> Note, the order of pages in each collection is intentional! Or in other words, for best results follow instructions in the order presented.



[collection__first_boot]: {{ 'first-boot.html' | absolute_url }}

[collection__virtual_box]: {{ 'virtual-box.html' | absolute_url }}
